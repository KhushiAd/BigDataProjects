# Streaming Finance Data with AWS Lambda

For this project, we used AWS Lambda to retrieve and process a real time data consumption, stored the data in an S3 Bucket, used Athena to query relevant information and then find insightful information and create visualizations using Jupyter Notebook. 

### The Assets folder contains screenshots for: 

1. S3 Bucket where the data streamed from Lambda is Stored 
2. The Athena Query and Results 
3. The Kinesis Monitor  
4. The Results from the executed code in Lambda 

### The Jupyter Notebooks contain codes for visualizations. 

1. COST has the maximum volatility
2. COST has the highest average daily volatility
3. EBAY has the lowest daily maximum volatility
4. Volatility for Amazon from 4/10/23 to 5/19/23
